## Literature Review
- "Message quality is a critical factor in influencing user acceptance of a
  program product." Usability testing on error messages; tool for conducting
  said testing. https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=801583
- Error messages displayed to non-programmer novice computer users
  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358639
- Addresses the question: do better error messages make the software easier to
  learn? An assessment of compiler error enhancement tools used pedagocically
  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3106169
- "Through rational reconstructions, we can identify how to design error
  messages that are most useful for developers, rather than those that are most
  convenient for the tool."

### The compiler error angle
- Analysis of cryptic compiler errors & impact on developers
  https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahci/2010/602570/abs/
- When black box components give vague error messages, you can't distinguish
  them in order to write better ones. Proposes a machine learning tool to
  characterize vague errors. https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1250747

### The pedagocical angle: helping students learn to program
- Inventory of common beginner programming mistakes (touches on the compiler
  errors again). Proposes educational tool for helping beginners
  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=611956
- Characterizing errors made by novice students
  https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/7889
- IDE with enhanced error messages for the most common compiler errors;
  evaluation of that IDE's effectiveness in helping students. 
  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2844584
- Haskell compiler for students designed to give more helpful compiler errors
  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=871902
- Custom IDE that collects data on errors encountered by new students.
  Inventory of top errors for new-to-Java students.

### The user error angle
- Error messages and their impact on system administrators
  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1036499


### Obscure items
- Patent for better error messaging to mobile phone users when something goes
  wrong, e.g. with decrypting a message.
