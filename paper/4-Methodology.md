## Selecting repositories to analyze
1. Choose languages: Languages I'm familiar with, at least one dynamically typed
   and one statically typed language
2. Choose repositories:
  - Open source so I can easily access them
  - On Github so I can easily access them
  - Top rated by # of stars
3. Accept only application repositories. Ignore:
  - Collections of code examples
  - Source for (primarily) static websites
  - Style guides
  - Design systems
4. Choose the top 20 in each language

### Github search to get top repositories:

 - **JavaScript**:
   https://github.com/search?l=javascript&o=desc&q=stars%3A%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories
